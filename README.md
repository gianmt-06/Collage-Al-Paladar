# Collage Al Paladar

This is a university project developed as a team with my partner, [@Alejo-Rodri](https://github.com/Alejo-Rodri), for the subject of Data Structures. It is about a distributed system using RMI for a restaurant.

This project consists of 4 modules:

- Administrator: responsible for registering users and dishes.
- Operator: responsible for registering and validating users, taking orders, and being able to modify or cancel them.
- Kitchen: implements a priority queue to organize orders and a system that manages the availability of stoves in the kitchen.
- Delivery: implements an algorithm to calculate the closest route the delivery person should take to reach their destination and deliver all the orders.
